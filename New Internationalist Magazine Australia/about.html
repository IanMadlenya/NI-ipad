    <h1>Fair Trade</h1>
    <p>As part of our commitment to Fair Trade, New Internationalist in Australia joined WFTO (the World Fair Trade Organization) in 2005, and became registered as a Fair Trade Organisation (FTO) in 2007.</p>
    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    <h4>Privacy Protection and Fair Trading</h4>
    <p><a href="http://www.adma.com.au/"></a>We value honesty, fair trading and privacy protection  and so subscribe fully to the Australian Direct  Marketing Association <a href="http://www.adma.com.au/comply/code-of-practice/" class="external_site">code of practice</a> for e-Commerce and direct marketing.</p>
    <h4>NI Privacy Policy:</h4>
    <p>At New Internationalist we want your on-line experience to be enjoyable and we take care to respect your privacy when you visit our web site. As a member of the Australian Direct Marketing Association (ADMA), we abide by a strict Code of Practice that demands we handle your personal details responsibly. This Code also requires that we act fairly and honestly in all of our customer transactions. <br /> We abide by the following principles:</p>
    <h4>We Provide Essential Online Information:</h4>
    <p>We provide clear, complete and up-to-date information online about our co-operative and the products and services we offer. This includes <a href="#contact">how to get in touch</a> with us. This information helps you to make informed choices. We keep complete and accurate records of online contracts when you accept one of our offers. Our system also helps you to keep an accurate record so there is no confusion about the contract. If you have a problem with any of our goods or services, we maintain information online about how to make a complaint, obtain redress or pursue dispute resolution. We have put in place an effective mechanism and procedure to help you. We can be e-mailed through <strong><a href="mailto:shop@newint.com.au?Subject=Problems%20with%20the%20NI%20app.">Helen Parsons</a></strong> (NI customer service) if there is a problem.</p>
    <h4>Information Collection and Use:</h4>
    <p>We only collect customer information that is necessary for what we do. For example, when you order online, we need to have your name, e-mail address, phone number, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This enables us to process your order and to notify you regarding its status (e.g., that it is on its way, or if we are temporarily out of stock, etc.). In addition, we limit the collection of highly sensitive information about customers (e.g., racial, ethnic origin, political opinions, etc.) because, in general, it is not necessary for what we do. We always tell you who we are and what we intend to do with your information when we receive it. We strive to be open - we will let you know what sort of personal information we hold, how we collect it, how we use and disclose it, if you want to know. We also ensure that your personal details are accurate, complete and up-to-date when we use or collect them through our verification process. We only collect personal information by lawful and fair means. This means we are never unreasonably intrusive when it comes to dealing with our customers. From time to time, we may also collect non-personal information from our customers. This helps us in our ongoing efforts to improve our web site and the on-line experience for our visitors. We also monitor our customers' usage of our web site to make improvements and provide other items you might want to know about. As much as possible, we will collect your information directly from you. In the unlikely event that we collect details about you from someone else, we will, whenever possible, make sure you know we have done this and why.</p>
    <h4>We Will Respect Your Preferences:</h4>
    <p>We may also use the information we collect to keep you abreast of changes in our web site, to inform you about new products and services, or to let you know about special offers you might find worthwhile. If you would rather not receive this information, you can e-mail to <a href="mailto:marketing@newint.com.au?Subject=Regarding%20privacy"><strong>NI Privacy</strong></a> to let us know. We always provide customers with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving future offers via snail mail or e-mail.</p>
    <h4>Offering Information to Other Parties:</h4>
    <p>We only use or disclose information about our customers in ways they would expect. This means we only use information to process your order or to improve our app. In terms of disclosure, there is only one instance where your name and address might leave our system. From time to time, we might pass your contact details to select organisations with similar aims to our own, and whose products or services we feel you might like to know about. We know that many of our customers enjoy receiving these offers. If you do not want your name exchanged in this way, please e-mail to <a href="mailto:marketing@newint.com.au?Subject=No%20name%20exchange%20please%20(NI%20app)"><strong>NI no name exchange</strong></a> and we will block any transfer of your details to a third party. If you do agree to have your details transferred, be reassured: we take steps to protect our customers' privacy if we transfer personal information about them to other organisations.</p>
    <h4>Let Us Know What You Think:</h4>
    <p>Privacy is a sensitive issue. At any time, if you believe we have not adhered to these principles, please let us know us by e-mail to <a href="mailto:marketing@newint.com.au?Subject=Re:%20NI%20privacy%20policy."><strong>NI Privacy comments</strong></a> and we will make every effort to review and correct the problem. We also welcome your questions and comments about our Privacy Policy.</p>
